"""Adaptive pacing for every background read Nexus makes against GP.

The rule this serves: neither Nexus nor its relay may ever contribute to an overload of the GP SQL
server. The fixed waits the PO mirror shipped with (#672) were a guess - right for the server as it was
that afternoon, wrong the moment somebody runs a month-end close - so they stay only as FLOORS. What
actually paces the reads is the server's own live state, which the relay now reports on every reply:

  - `cost` {cpu_ms, logical_reads, elapsed_ms}: what the op it just ran cost, by SQL Server's own
    accounting for that session. This is the number a CPU budget can be enforced against.
  - `server` {sql_cpu_pct, other_cpu_pct, runnable_tasks, sampled_at, source}: a sample of the whole
    instance, from the scheduler-monitor ring buffer. `source: "unavailable"` when the relay's SQL
    login lacks VIEW SERVER STATE, in which case pacing runs on cost and elapsed time alone.

Three mechanisms, in increasing order of bluntness:

  1. BUDGET. A token bucket of GP_SYNC_READS_PER_MINUTE, where a token is one PO (or job) a request
     will ask GP for, spent before the request goes out. Bounded work per request (GP_SYNC_READ_BATCH
     keys) and a fixed number of reads per minute - not a gap between requests, because a gap between
     two unbounded requests is still an unbounded read.
  2. PRESSURE. Per (company, op) rolling median of elapsed_ms. An op that took more than 3x its own
     median is the server telling us it is busy, and it is the only such signal available without
     VIEW SERVER STATE - so it charges the bucket an extra batch.
  3. PAUSE. With a real server sample, CPU at or above the pause threshold (or the runnable-task queue
     backed up) stops background reads outright, and a `server_busy` refusal from the relay does the
     same. Resume needs BOTH numbers back under their resume thresholds, and the CPU pause line and
     resume line are the same number by decision - reads may continue only below it.

The state lives in one process-wide POLICY shared by the PO mirror and the job sync, because the thing
being protected is one SQL server and two independent budgets would each politely stay under half of a
limit neither of them owns. Everything that decides anything is a pure function taking numbers and
returning numbers, so the policy is testable without a relay, a database, or a clock.

    True if the policy is now running again.

    The probe is `server_load`, which the relay exempts from its channel pin and never refuses, so it
    goes out with an empty company and needs none in hand - a paused policy can therefore recover even
    with no hello landed and no company known. It is deliberately NOT budget-paced and NOT marked
    background: it reads the ring buffer and nothing else, and it is the only way out of the pause.

    A probe that cannot answer leaves the pause exactly as it was and tries again next interval; the
    alternative, resuming because we could not ask, is precisely the wrong failure. The one exception
    is a relay that does not have the op at all, which can only happen if the workstation rolled BACK
    to a build predating it while we were paused - there is no way to ask that relay anything, so
    staying paused would wedge the mirror forever. That resumes, into cost-only pacing."""
